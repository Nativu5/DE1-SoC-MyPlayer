# DE1-SoC-MyPlayer

## Requirement

Tested on the following platform/software:

* Quartus Prime 18.0 on Windows 10
* Intel SoC FPGA Embedded Development Suite Standard 18.0 on Windows 10
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for DE1-SoC provided by Terasic's website
* FFmpeg

Before you give these codes a try, make sure you have the operating system and all the software installed correctly. Besides, please refer to DE1-SoC User Manual for setting up board to run Linux.

## Hardware

To build sof file:

1. Open the `soc_system.qpf` with Quartus.
2. Click `Compile Design` to build sof file.
3. Use Programmer in Quartus to program the FPGA.

Note: if any change is made to Qsys design, the C header file must be regenerated. The software should also be re-compiled with the newly generated header so that it can work properly. 

## Software

The hardware part only gives you a basis to play sounds with DE1-SoC, and the software is here to process the music data and configure your SoC to play correctly.

To build and run the software:

1. Open the SoC EDS Command Shell.
2. Change directory to the `software` folder, for example, `cd ~/DE1-SoC-MyPlayer/software`.
3. Type `make clean` to remove files generated by earlier builds, then type `make`.
4. If the building is successful,  you can find `MyPlayer` binary file in the folder. Download it to the board.
5. Use `chmod +x ./MyPlayer` on board to give the binary permission to execute.
6. Type `./Myplayer filename` to run the program. `filename` should be replaced with your own music filename.
